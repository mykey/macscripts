## Scripts I wrote for my Macbook Pro

### battery_cycles.sh

A basic script to keep an eye on the number of cylces the battery has uncharged. I will update this with some sort of logging mechanism, so I can plot graphs over time.

### charge_remaining.sh

This script outputs common battery information, since the battery percentage in the upper right corner is never right.

### muisbatterij.sh

This script gives me the battery percentage of my magic mouse on the command line, since it's way faster then clicking 5 times to learn this info from the system settings.
