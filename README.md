# macscripts
## Scripts I wrote for my Macbook Pro

Scripts I wrote, modified, adapted and/or collected for my Macbook Pro. I put some time in these scripts, but like everything in the UNIX-verse, I'm standing on the shoulders of giants here. 

Probably defunct by now: I stopped owning a mac in 2018, so these scripts have probably stopped or will probably stop working and will need some adaptation. 

### battery_cycles.sh

A basic script to keep an eye on the number of cylces the battery has uncharged. I will update this with some sort of logging mechanism, so I can plot graphs over time (with a cronjob).

### charge_remaining.sh

This script outputs common battery information, since the battery percentage in the upper right corner is never right.

### muisbatterij.sh

This script gives me the battery percentage of my magic mouse on the command line, since it's way faster then clicking 5 times to learn this info from the system settings.
